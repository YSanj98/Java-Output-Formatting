# Hacker Rank Java Output Formatting

## Explanation
Each String is left-justified with trailing whitespace through the first 15  characters. The leading digit of the integer is the
16th character, and each integer that was less than 3 digits now has leading zeroes.

## input format
Every line of input will contain a String followed by an integer.
Each String will have a maximum of 10 alphabetic characters, and each integer will be in the inclusive range from 0 to 999.

### sample input 
java 100<br />
cpp 65<br />
python 50

DSA 60<br />
java 100<br />
SE 9

## output format
In each line of output there should be two columns:
The first column contains the String and is left justified using exactly 15 characters.
The second column contains the integer, expressed in exactly 3 digits; if the original input has less than three digits, you must pad your output's leading digits with zeroes.
